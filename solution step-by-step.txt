How to handle the problem:
--------------------------

1. Examine the problem. I need to gather the following information from the pages using web scraping:
	- property name
	- property type
	- bedroom number
	- bathroom number
	- amenities list

The first link does not go to a valid page (this must be handled in the code, i.e. give an error like "property not available" or similar).

2. Research how to do web scraping (specifically in Python) as I have not done so before.

After doing the research, I found the requests library can be used to get the html for the webpage and BeautifulSoup can be used to parse that html. However, after trying this I realised requests only works when the page doesn't use javascript, so instead I'll use Selenium.

3. Examine the webpages. Where can the information I'm looking for be found? Using the page inspection tool on the browser is especially helpful to see the html structure.

The page structure is not like I've seen before with A LOT of divs within divs within divs... And they have seem to have random class names, but they are consistent across pages.

Important classes include:
	- h1 "_fecoyn4" : property name
	- div "_tqmy57" : bedrooms, bathrooms (each in own <span>)
	- div "_1qsawv5" : property type, e.g. "Entire home"
	- div "_gw4xx4" : each amenity

4. Code the solution.
